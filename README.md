# Genga Post-Processing Scripts

This is the barebones version to the post-processing scripts we're using for [Genga](https://bitbucket.org/sigrimm/genga/) outputs.

You can use the files in the Helpers subdirectory to make the [Demo Notebook](https://cheleb.net/ipython/astro/04-GengaPandas.html) work.

Questions, comments, rants should be sent to [volker@cheleb.net](mailto:volker@cheleb.net).
